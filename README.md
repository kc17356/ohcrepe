Code First: Girls project --> team Oh Crepe!


Here are the guidelines for the competition (taken from the notes PDF)! I thought I'd put them here so we have easy access.
Must have:
  ● A live website published on GitHub pages
  ● A minimum of two HTML files for:
    ○ 1 x home page/landing page linked to a separate CSS file
    ○ 1 x ‘about’ page
  ● A minimum of one CSS files
  ● Good formatting
    ○ Code split into the appropriate files (separate HTML files & CSS files)
    ○ Files indented properly
  ● Good organisation
  ● Version control using git
  ● Sensible git commit messages
Nice to have:
  ● A visually appealing design - good use of CSS and HTML elements, Bootstrap,
    jQuery & JavaScript (don’t worry you’ll learn about these last three topics next
    week!)
  ● A contact form (for example name and email)
  ● Social buttons
  ● As many different HTML elements you can manage
  ● Interactive elements (like forms) on your website don’t need to be functional,
    but should be present if they need to be for the visual aspect of the design.
  ● A responsive site
