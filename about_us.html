  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>What is this place?</h2>
  <p>Living with any food intolerance or allergy can be tricky, especially as a student.
     Finding recipies that you like, that are affordable, and that you can actually eat is
     a real challenge. Not to mention that when buying food and drink substitutes the price
     of your weekly shop shoots up - a gluten intolerance or allergy adds on average Â£300
     per year to your food spending!</p>
  <h2>Our mission?</h2>
  <p>We want to take the confusion and guess work out of cooking when you have an allergy
     or intolerance. This website contains a collection of recipies appropriate for different
     dietary requirements, from gluten-free, to lactose-free, to low-FODMAP, and some vegetarian
     and vegan recipies too!</p>
  <h2>Testimonials</h2>
  <blockquote>I really struggled with cooking when I first went to uni, this website enabled
    me to cook with confidence!</blockquote>
